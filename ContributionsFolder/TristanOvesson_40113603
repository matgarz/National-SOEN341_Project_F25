Dates: Sept 13-Sept 23: 
I participated in the first meeting which lasted about 20min. Then got very sick and was not able to do much school work for 10 days. 
I kept up to date by checking the gitHub and Discord regularly to stay involved in the discussions. 
I did this for about 15-30min daily depending on how much was added. 

Sept 24: 
After recovering, I was able to go through all User Stories written by my teammates and evaluate each of them in Issues.
I wrote down comments on the stories I thought could be reworked and left the others for my teammates to see. I did not resolve any of these issues.
I also made some Conversations and Confirmations for some stories with the help of our communication about these stories through Discord.
This took me 2 hours.

Sept 25: 
To continue, I helped my team make a list on what to finalize to meet all our requirements for Sprint 1 which is due tonight, September 25, 2025.
We have a laboratory tonight where we've planned to all meet before the lab starts and finalize everything together. 

I created my own branch from the main branch and inside it created the ContributionsFolder where all our contributions should be.
After writing this, I will make a pull request so that all my teammates complete this section as well. This took me about 1 hour.

Overall time spent on project so far: 
20min + 15min*10days + 2hours + 1hour = 350min = 5 hours and 50 minutes.
