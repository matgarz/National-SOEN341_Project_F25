## Sprint 1: 

Week 1 & 2: Participated in initial meetings, met the team members and formed a discord group for discussion and planning. I contributed
to the ReadMe files, Github issues and other files. I also contributed in deciding which frameworks to use for the project and the coding laguages.
I strongly suggested using SQL and PostgreSQL for database management and handling. Additionally, I took the meeting minutes for the
second meeting and added the requirements for the upcoming week. Week 3: Participated in the meeting and contacted with team member 
online since I was ill and stayed at home. I mostly contributed through online. 

Total time spent: first lab + second lab + extra time on the discord server = 1 hr 40 min + 45 min + ~20 min = 2 hr 45 min

## Sprint 2: 

Frontend + Backend + Database + Task Management
- Created and Built Home Page UI for the Student user
- used libraries and components like Shadcn, figma, etc.
- Implemented backend API code for fetching data from DB
- Fixed the Login/register implementation and logic on both frontend and backend sides
- Managed task distribution in discord as well as through Jira
- Keeping up with member tasks and daily sprint goals through regular communication

Week 3: Implemented Home page UI + Backend API fetching (took me around a day = ~ 13 hours)
Week 4: Used Jira for project and task management (around 2 hours)
        Fixed Login/Register page implementation issues with backend (took me almsot a day too = ~ 12 hours)

Additionally, I have been very consistent and keeping up with everyone and their deliverables. I also helped with task distribution and Issues extensively during the second week of Sprint 2. 

Almost always active on discord but an estimate of daily Discord involvement: 1 hour for 5 days = 5 hours.

## Sprint 3:

- Built, worked on and fixed the issues with CI Testing workflows using Github Actions (~3 hours on Oct 30)
- Created a Project and connected it to this repository. Then I linked and assigned the issues and pull reuqests under different tabs (like ToDo, Ready, Done, etc.) within the Project. This helped significantly with Sprint Planning. (~3 hours on Oct 26)

- Made the technical architecture as well as wrote down the technical documentation for the project. (Worked on the diagram with Matteo) (~2 hours on Nov 2)
- As a scrum master, I kept track of the tasks to be done with the help of issues. I also tracked all the pull request changes, reviewed and approved them for merge. Handled multiple pull requests together (throughout sprint 3)
- Kept up with everyone on Discord with their tasks and made sure the sprint goals are met before the deadline with all the requirements as mentioned in the Sprint 3 document. (throughout Sprint 3)
- Also attended weekly meetings during the labs (~ 5 hours total)
