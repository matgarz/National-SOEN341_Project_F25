Week 1 & 2: Participated in initial meetings, met the team members and formed a discord group for discussion and planning. I contributed
to the ReadMe files, Github issues and other files. I also contributed in deciding which frameworks to use for the project and the coding laguages.
I strongly suggested using SQL and PostgreSQL for database management and handling. Additionally, I took the meeting minutes for the
second meeting and added the requirements for the upcoming week. Week 3: Participated in the meeting and contacted with team member 
online since I was ill and stayed at home. I mostly contributed through online. 

Total time spent: first lab + second lab + extra time on the discord server = 1 hr 40 min + 45 min + ~20 min = 2 hr 45 min
